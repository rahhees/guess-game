# 🎯 Guess the Number – Python Game

This is a simple Python game where the computer randomly selects a number between **1 and 10**, and the user has to guess it.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The program generates a random number.
- The user is prompted to guess the number.
- If the guess is correct ➡️ **"You Won!"**
- If the guess is wrong ➡️ **"You Lost. The number was X"**
- The game runs **infinitely** until the user exits manually.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- `random` module
- `input()` for user interaction
- Basic terminal/console interface

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the code.
